SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM WATER QUALITY PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

This is a project based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. 
It is a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), which has the 
capability of remembering long-term information. It consists of three gates:-
input gate, output gate and memory gate. LSTM works on the frequently used 
logistic function.

We have created our LSTM model using Keras Library. Data has been collected from
the USGS NWIS online data repository. Pandas library has been used for data analysis
and manipulation. Matplotlib library has been used for data visualization.

Our LSTM NN models has a visible layer with 1 input, a hidden layer with 16 LSTM neurons,
and a dense layer that outputs a single value prediction. The model has been trained for 100
epochs and a batch size of 1 has been used.

LSTM has performed well for time-series forecasting the future. According to our study
also, it has shown tremendous results.
